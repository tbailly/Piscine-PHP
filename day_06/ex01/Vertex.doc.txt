The Vertex class handles coordinates for a point.

An instance is constructed using x, y and z coordinates (mandatory):
new Vertex( array( 'x' => 1.23, 'y' => 4.56, 'z' => 7.89 ) );

Two other variable can also be added (coordinate w and color):
new Vertex( array( 'x' => 1.23, 'y' => 4.56, 'z' => 7.89, 'w' => 2.3, 'color' => $color) );

If w variable is set by default to 1.0.
The color is set to default to white (255, 255, 255).

x, y, z and w are converted to floats and their precision is not modified.
color should be an instance of Color class.
Any other use is undefined behaviour.

The class provides no other methods than accessors.
